The podcast hosts cover the economics of data centers, the mechanics of utility electricity prices, infrastructure to support higher energy use, and the impact of data center construction and operation on the American public. The podcast frames this topic through a discussion of a recent paper on data centers and energy use. The podcast guest is skeptical of claims from utilities and data center companies and critical of the environmental and other impacts from data centers.",n/a,sustainability,Social Science: Environment and Resource Economics,https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/repository/cleanlaw-who-will-pay-for-data-centers-massive-power-bills-its-probably-you/,English,???,"Peskoe, Ari, Eliza Martin.

Such research has found that “prebunking” or “inoculation” techniques — strategies that reduce the acceptance of misinformation before one has encountered it — have had marked success. One of the most successful prebunking interventions is the game “Bad News,” developed by Roozenbeek and van der Linden (2019). In the game, participants try to gain as many followers as possible on their social media platform. To do this, players engage in the strategies of misinformation-creators: they fabricate information, sow doubt about credible public figures and organizations, and promote belief in conspiracy theories, all of which increases engagement with the players’ posts. In the process, participants learn how misinformation is created and how appealing it can be, which raises their skepticism and improves their ability to identify misinformation. Chaos Creator is a modified version of the Bad News game. It incorporates the prebunking strategies of raising skepticism by describing common misinformation persuasion tactics. Students play the game in-person during a library information literacy instruction one-shot session.","Identify strategies used to spread misinformation online in order to avoid engaging with false or misleading messages. Assess the reliability of claims made by various sources in order to avoid engaging with false or misleading messages.

It walks them through an example of training data by ""helping"" a local Baltimore icon, Mr. Trashwheel, learn how to tell the difference between fish and trash. Examples can easily be swapped out for the local context that the lesson will be taught in. It then goes on to provide an activity about generating AI art. This opens the class up to conversations around ownership and feelings around what is being generated by the prompts supplied to AI.","Explain that AI is a computer that is trained on data given to it by humans.

This video series features maps of different vintages, locations and purposes. We'll look at maps together and discuss what we see at first glance then focus in on details learning about different map elements along the way, such as scale, legends and symbology, latitude and longitude, milage charts, and publication information. Maps are fun to look at as we can explore not just different places, but different times in history as well. Some overall concepts we’ll cover across the series is that places change over time, as do map making techniques, but there are still commonalities and standards over time. Seeing lots of examples can also help those who make maps themselves - just as reading makes you a better writer. Another major point across the series is that maps are communication pieces, so like writing map makers need to know the map’s purpose and audience when choosing which information to include or exclude, and how to present it in a way that makes sense to the readers/users.",n/a,visual literacy; critical use; evaluation,Built Environment and Design: Visual Communication Design,https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLck5cNZ38te7TrreC3tBbtcuiNQqXyw6X,English,???,"Miami University Libraries.
